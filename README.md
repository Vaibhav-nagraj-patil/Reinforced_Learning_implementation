This MATLAB script simulates an autonomous agent navigating a dynamic grid environment under constrained exploration time, employing real-time decision-making mechanisms for obstacle avoidance and backtracking. The grid is initialized as a 2D array with designated obstacles marked as impenetrable, and the agent's motion is modeled via a discrete action space defined by cardinal movements. The algorithm incorporates a probabilistic exploration strategy using random sampling within permissible directions, validated against a state-space model that excludes visited nodes and obstructed cells. A recursive backtracking heuristic is deployed for path continuity in the absence of viable exploration directions, ensuring connectivity across the traversed graph. Upon expiration of the exploration timer, a breadth-first search (BFS)-based path reconstruction algorithm calculates the optimal route back to the origin, leveraging parent-child mapping in a containerized structure for efficient memory utilization. Visualization is dynamically updated at each iteration, offering real-time trajectory plotting and distinguishing explored, active, and return-path states using a multi-layered graphical overlay. The implementation emphasizes modular function architecture to segregate navigation, decision-making, and visualization logic, facilitating scalability for more complex navigational paradigms.
